## The Sweetest Pitch (yum) ⤦

Educators are often frustrated by the lack of tools and funding to truly streamline easy educational platforms for students to use that are not only user-friendly but have a focal point on accessability, as education is for all.
Our App eliminates the outdated tools / options in the educational sector and offers a one stop-shop for educators and students, Welcome to Class.
Seeing a rise in educational sector hiccups due to outdated and commplicated tech especially during these hard times (COVID-19), leading to a higher percentage of students losing education and educators unable to provide education we seek to answer this call.
With Class, you can reduce the workload on educators offer a highly effcient learning enviorment to students and cut out the outdated and pointer tech that forces educators and students to use x amount of tools for one assignment / lesson as Class will aggregate it all!
